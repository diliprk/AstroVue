An open-source project using `Vue.js` that renders South-Indian style horoscope chart and tables for the Krishnamurthi Paddhati system.
This project is a companion to the [VedicAstro](https://github.com/diliprk/VedicAstro) as it uses the FastAPI call from
the `VedicAstro` library to get the positions, aspects and significators of the planets and houses. <br>

**NOTE**: Please get this [VedicAstroAPI python API](https://github.com/diliprk/VedicAstro/blob/main/VedicAstroAPI.py) running, by following the installation steps in the [VedicAstro](https://github.com/diliprk/VedicAstro/tree/main#installation) Git Repo.
