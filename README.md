# AstroVue
An open-source project using `vue.js` that renders a south indian style horoscope charting and other analytics.
This project is a companion to the [VedicAstro](https://github.com/diliprk/VedicAstro) as it uses the FastAPI call from
the `VedicAstro` library to get the positions, aspects and significators of the planets and houses. <br>
